      <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>2 tablespoons baking soda</li>
          <li>1 cup self-rising flour, plus more for kneading</li>
          <li>1 cup plain Greek yogurt</li>
          <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon coarse salt, or as needed</li>
        </ul> 

      <h2>Directions</h2>

      <h3>Step 1</h3>

      <p>Bring 6 cups of water to a low boil in a large pot. Add baking soda.</p>

      <h3>Step 2</h3>

      <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.</p>

      <h3>Step 3</h3>

      <p>Mix 1 cup flour and Greek yogurt together in a medium bowl until a shaggy dough forms.<br>
         Transfer to a surface dusted with more self-rising flour, and knead for 8 to 10 minutes.<br>
         Continue adding flour as needed if the dough is too sticky.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Step 4</h3>

      <p>Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. Roll each segment into a long, thin rope, 22 to 24 inches in length.<br>
         Twist the rope into a pretzel shape by taking the two ends, twisting them around each other, then securing<br>
         both ends side-by-side onto the center portion of the rope.
     </p>

      <h3>Step 5</h3>

      <p>One by one, carefully drop each pretzel into the water and boil until the pretzel floats to the top, 2 to 3 minutes.<br>
         Drain on paper towels or a cooling rack.
     </p>

      <h3>Step 6</h3>

      <p>Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.</p>

     <h3>Step 7</h3>

     <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and increase the oven's temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).<br>
        Brush the pretzels with some of the melted butter; continue to bake until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes more. Brush with remaining butter<br>
        and top with coarse salt.
