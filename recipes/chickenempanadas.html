          <li>2 tablespoons dried currants</li>
          <li>2 (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with green chile peppers</li>
          <li>⅓ cup water</li>
          <li>¾ cup grated pepper Jack cheese (Optional)</li>
          <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons water</li>
        </ul> 

      <h3>For the Dough:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li>1 and a ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>12 tablespoons cold unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>⅓ cup cold water, or as needed</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Directions</h2>

      <h3>Step 1</h3>

      <p>Pour olive oil into a saucepan; add onion, poblano, garlic, salt, pepper, chipotle,<br>
         cumin, oregano, cayenne, and cooked chicken, pressing down as you go. Add currants.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 2</h3>

      <p>Place saucepan over high heat; cook until onions begin to soften slightly,<br>
         about 3 minutes. Stir in diced tomatoes with green chiles. Pour in 1/3 cup water and mix to combine.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 3</h3>

      <p>Bring mixture to a simmer; reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally,<br>
         until liquids are cooked down, 30 to 45 minutes.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Step 4</h3>

      <p>Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Chill thoroughly before use, 1 to 2 hours.</p>

      <h3>Step 5</h3>

      <p>While filling simmers, combine flour, salt, and sugar for dough in a bowl with your hand. Grate in cold butter,<br>
         pausing as needed to combine. Drizzle in beaten egg and water. Mix with a fork until it starts to form a shaggy dough.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 6</h3>

      <p>Use your hands to squeeze mixture into a lump of dough; transfer to a work surface and knead into a ball of dough, 10 to 15 seconds.</p>

     <h3>Step 7</h3>

     <p>Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, up to overnight.</p>

     <h3>Step 8</h3>
    
     <p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>

     <h3>Step 9</h3>

     <p>Unwrap chilled dough and transfer to a lightly floured work surface. Use a bench scraper to divide into 8 equal pieces.</p>

     <h3>Step 10</h3>

     <p>Roll each dough piece into an 8-inch circle.</p>

     <h3>Step 11</h3>

     <p>Drain any excess juice from filling. Top each dough circle with a rounded 1/2-cup measure of the chicken mixture.<br>
       Sprinkle some pepper Jack cheese over top.
     </p>

     <h3>Step 12</h3>

     <p>Brush edges of each dough circle with a small amount of water to dampen; fold over and seal with fingertips,<br>
       making sure to not trap in any pockets of air. Crimp using your fingertips or a fork.
     </p>

     <h3>Step 13</h3>

     <p>Combine beaten egg and 2 teaspoons water for egg wash. Transfer empanadas to the prepared baking sheet and<br>
       brush over egg wash. Sprinkle with cayenne.
     </p>

     <h3>Step 14</h3>

     <p>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until browned and crispy on the edges, about 35 minutes.<br>
       Transfer to a wire rack to cool for about 5 minutes before serving.
